<h2>All About Our Game &amp; Team: </h2>

<p class="paragraph-text">
While there are many versions of Bubble-Burst, no one (including Wikipedia) seems to know who invented it the game itself. However, it is derived from another popular game called Bust-A-Move, which belongs to the genre of 3-Match Games where one must put like things together to get rid of them and progress.</p>
